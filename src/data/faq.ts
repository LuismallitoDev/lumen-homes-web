    {
        q: "Do I have to sign a long-term contract?",
        a: "Never. We believe in earning your business every month. Our agreements are month-to-month and you can cancel with 30 days' notice if your plans change."
    },
    {
        q: "How do you handle guest screening?",
        a: "We act as your firewall. We use strict algorithm-based screening, require identity verification for all bookings, and have a zero-tolerance policy for parties. We prioritize quality of guest over quantity of bookings."
    },
    {
        q: "Can I use my own property?",
        a: "Absolutely. You retain full ownership. Simply block out the dates you wish to use in our owner portal app, and we will ensure no guests are booked for those days. It's your home first."
    },
    {
        q: "What happens if a guest damages something?",
        a: "Our strategy is prevention, but for contingencies, we ensure every booking is covered by liability insurance and damage protection (AirCover or independent policies). We handle the claims process end-to-end."
    },
    {
        q: "When and how do I get paid?",
        a: "We process payouts monthly. You receive a detailed financial statement by the 5th, and direct deposits hit your bank account by the 15th of each month."
    },
    {
        q: "Who handles the cleaning and laundry?",
        a: "For Lumen Signature clients, we manage 100% of this. We work with 5-star hotel-grade cleaning teams. Linens are professionally laundered off-site to ensure crisp, sanitary perfection every time."
    },
    {
        q: "How quickly can you onboard my property?",
        a: "From the moment you sign, we aim to be live in 14 days. This includes photography, copywriting, platform setup, and operational inspections."
    },
    {
        q: "Do you furnish the properties?",
        a: "We do not provide furniture, but for 'Blueprint' clients, we offer an interior design consultation add-on where we can procure and install furniture for an additional fee to meet the Lumen Standard."
    },
    {
        q: "What platforms will my home be listed on?",
        a: "We maximize exposure by listing on Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, Expedia, Marriott Homes & Villas (if eligible), and our own direct booking site to save on fees."
    },
    {
        q: "Are there any hidden fees?",
        a: "Transparency is a core value. Our management fee is a flat percentage of revenue. You only pay for third-party costs (cleaning, maintenance supplies) at cost—we do not mark these up."
